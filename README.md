Car price prediction uses machine learning to estimate the price of a vehicle based on features like make, model, year, mileage, and condition. It involves analyzing historical sales data to identify patterns and relationships between attributes and prices. Algorithms like linear regression, decision trees, or neural networks are often employed. Accurate predictions help buyers, sellers, and businesses make informed decisions in the automobile market.
